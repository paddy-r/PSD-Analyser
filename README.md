## **PSD Analyser**

### Hugh Patrick Rice, January 2021 onwards

### **A set of Python/MATLAB tools for particle size distribution (PSD) analysis and visualisation**

*Includes*
1. Parsing of *Mastersizer* files in spreadsheet (CSV, Excel) formats
2. Log-normal modelling of PSDs
3. Application to PSDs of the product difference algorithm (PDA) to PSDs, which computes the discrete distribution of *N* elements with the same moments
4. Visualisation of results in interactive viewer, allowing output of figures in various formats (currently Python only)

*Note on history and previous implementation*
- The concepts behind *PSD Analyser* were developed during research that led to the production of references (1) and (2). Please refer to those for more details and examples.
